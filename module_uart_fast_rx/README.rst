XSoftIP Simple/Fast UART Receiver
====================================

:scope: Experimental
:description: Basic Uart Receiver where the functionality of the full generic uart receiver module is not required 
:keywords: UART
:boards: XK-SKC-L2

This basic uart receiver is very simple, and implements baud rates which can be derived directly from the 100 MHz reference clock. Baud rates like 115.2KBaud are not supported. This simplicity enables this module to achieve very high baud rates well in excess of 1 MBaud.
